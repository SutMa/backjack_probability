Make sure you have node and npm installed
You can use nvm for this too

Install vite - (tool to create a react project)
Install typescript

cd into the client folder
npm run dev to run dev environment version of the app
make sure when pushing only push from the home folder of blackjack_probability
or else it will mess up

Make sure when you commit do not forget to ignore the node_modules folder

When you commiting:
Make branches for every version/functionality you are working on
This is to prevent the code from  breaking.

Thanks.
