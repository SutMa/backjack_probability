Make sure you have node and npm installed
You can use nvm for this too

Install vite - (tool to create a react project)
Install typescript

cd into the client folder
npm install 
npm run dev to run dev environment version of the app

make sure when pushing only push/commit from the home folder of blackjack_probability
or else it will mess up

Make sure when you commit do not forget to ignore the node_modules folder

When you commiting:
PLZ FOR THE LOVE OF GOD 
Make branches for every version/functionality you are working on
This is to prevent the code from  breaking.

Thanks.
