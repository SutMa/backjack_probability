Make sure you have node and npm installed
You can use nvm for this too

Install vite - (tool to create a react project)
Install typescript

Make sure when you commit do not forget to ignore the node_modules folder

When you commiting:
Make branches for every version/functionality you are working on
This is to prevent the code from  breaking.

Thanks.
